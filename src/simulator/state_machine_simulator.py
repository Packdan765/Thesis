"""
State Machine Simulator for HRL Museum Agent

A literature-grounded visitor simulator with coherent state machine design:
- Deterministic state transitions based on agent actions
- Non-overlapping dwell ranges for clear reward signals
- LLM-generated utterances that match visitor state sentiment
- Recovery actions that the agent can learn

Literature grounding:
- OVERLOADED: Working memory ~4 items (Bitgood 2013, Cowan 2001)
- FATIGUED: Question spacing 3-5 turns (Woo et al. 2024)
- CURIOUS: Users expect responses to questions (Grice 1975)
- CONFUSED: Conversational repair sequences (Schegloff et al. 1977)
- READY_TO_MOVE: Variety seeking after satiation (Bitgood 2013)
